    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Lasagna is a classic recipe that every cook should have in their rotation.</p>
    <p>The best lasagna recipe is made with ingredients that you know, and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lasagna</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomtato Paste</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Mozarella</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Beef & Sausage</li>
        <li>Pasta Sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! This is a really easy lasagna recipe.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Pasta:</strong> Cook in a large pot of salted water</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer & bake:</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to layer Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
        <li> Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
        <li> Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How long to Bake</h2>
    <p>Bake this lasagna recipe for a total of one hour. To get a perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Layer and cover it tightly with aluminum foil to retain the moisture.</li>
        <li> Once cooked, and heated through, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and the lasagna is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Important: Let the Lasagna Rest</h2>
    <p>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
